        <h1>State</h1>
        <p>My first year of joining FBLA I went to state in the year of 2018-2019. There I competed in E-business along with marketing. 
            I presented my website that was based on a photography webiste called Golden Cove Photography. Me and my partner
            Abraham decided to do photography because we felt that a photography business was something that our community 
            could have benefited from. We showed off the benefits of our website along with what we offer as to scheduling, prices
            and our content. We ending up placing second in the event.

    <aside id="nationals">
        <h1>Nationals</h1>
        <p>After placing second at state, Abraham and I got to go to Nationals. Nationals was located in Texas, there we meet
            so many incredible people from all over the world who shared the same passion as we did. It was amazing to the confrences, to
            the workshops, to competing. We did face some challenges such as our monitor not connecting to Abraham's laptop. Luckily, I had 
            brought mine and we quicly fixed the issue. Sadly we did not place but the experienceoverall was amaizng and taught me a lot.
